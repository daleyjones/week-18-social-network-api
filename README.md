# Social Network API

This is a project for building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the ODM.

## Description

MongoDB is chosen as the database for its efficiency with handling large amounts of data and its flexibility with unstructured data. The project aims to provide the foundational API for a social networking platform, allowing users to perform various actions such as creating and reacting to thoughts, and managing their friend lists.
